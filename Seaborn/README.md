### Seaborn (Python) 

This folder contains my practice scripts for Seaborn, a Python library for statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib. Seaborn works directly with pandas DataFrames and makes it easy to explore data using categorical plots, distribution plots, relational plots, and regression plots.


### Categorical Plots

    For comparing categories and showing distributions across discrete groups.

    Key Functions:
        countplot() - Show counts of categorical observations
        barplot() - Point estimates and confidence intervals as bars, aggregate (mean by default) per category.
        boxplot() - Show quartiles and outliers
        catplot() - Figure-level interface for categorical plots (row, col)
        violinplot() - Combination of boxplot and KDE - distribution shape plus summary statistics
        stripplot() - Scatterplot for categorical data - Shows individual points
        swarmplot() - Non-overlapping categorical scatter - Shows individual points arranged to avoid overlap


### Distribution Plots

    For visualizing distributions of data, both univariate and bivariate.

    Key Functions:
        histplot() - Histogram with optional KDE
        kdeplot() - Kernel Density Estimate plot
        rugplot() - Marginal ticks for distributions
        scatterplot() - Relational scatter plot between two numeric variables
        ecdfplot() - Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function
        displot() - Figure-level distribution plots
        jointplot() - Bivariate relationships with marginals
        pairplot() - Pairwise relationships in dataset

### Relational Plots

    For visualizing relationships between variables.

    Key Functions:
        scatterplot() - Relational scatter plot with multiple dimensions
        lineplot() - Line plot with confidence intervals
        relplot() - Figure-level relational plots with faceting
